It is believed that Lord Shiva attained all these siddhis by her grace, and half of his body became that of the Goddess, earning him the name 'Ardhanarishvara'.", "She is the culmination of all the previous eight forms of Durga, representing the ultimate attainment of spiritual power and perfection. Worshipping her on this day is believed to grant not just spiritual enlightenment but also mastery over worldly desires and attachments.", "Purple, the color of this day, represents ambition, power, and opulence. It signifies the attainment of the highest spiritual and material goals, a fitting color for the Goddess who grants all forms of perfection.", "In Mysuru, this day is celebrated as 'Mahanavami' and is famously known for Ayudha Puja. The royal sword, weapons, and tools of all professions are worshipped, symbolizing respect for the instruments that help sustain life and dharma. The state elephant, horses, and camels are also worshipped on this auspicious day."]},

An idol of the Goddess is placed in a magnificent Golden Howdah, weighing over 750 kg, on the back of a decorated elephant, which parades through the city streets.", "The color of this day is often bright and celebratory, like Peacock Green or Turquoise, representing the festive grandeur and the triumph of the divine. It is a day of immense joy, where people exchange Banni leaves as a symbol of gold and good fortune.", "The procession starts from the magnificent Mysuru Palace and culminates at the Bannimantap Grounds, where the Banni tree is worshipped. The day's festivities conclude with the spectacular Torchlight Parade, a dazzling display of equestrian skills, daredevil stunts, and a grand fireworks display, bringing the ten-day celebration to a majestic end."]}
